      "As you continue down the spire, you notice a group of humanoids waiting in ambush nearby a large auditorium. When approached, the Slavers are startled, but quickly explain themselves. NL NL \"CHAMPION! You grave us with your presence! Are you here to take on the new challenger?\"",
      "A new challenger? How delightful! NL NL However, the challenge may have to wait. The audience always likes seeing the Champion slaughter the latest capture...",
      "You enter the massive stadium to find an overflowing audience of #bSlavers, #pCultists, and other denizens of the City. NL NL ",
      "@\"WHO@ @DARES@ @CHALLENGE@ @ME?!\"@ you boom into the crowd, beckoning this new 'challenger'. NL A knight approaches, clad in strikingly similar armor to your own, only drenched in black ink. The crowd cheers more than this pretender deserves. NL NL There can only be one Champion!",
      "@\"THE@ @NEXT@ @ONE@ @IS@ @MINE!\"@ you boom into the crowd, who replies with a deafening applause. NL NL It does not take long for the slavers to drag in their latest catch. The unwitting challenger awakens, ~groggy~ from the ambush, but readies themselves. NL NL This should be fun.",
      "You deciding that, though it is tempting, fighting here would be an unnecessary distraction. Your journey continues on, and you leave the slavers to resume their ambush."
