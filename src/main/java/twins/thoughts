-Keywords:
Blaster, Shield, Core - keywords and piles. Cards with the keyword move into the pile instead of discard when played.
Fire - play a card from a specified pile, paying all costs. Blasters/Shields/Cores will typically leave into play, then come back to their piles.
Burnout - Blasters/Shields/Cores with Burnout will instead move to Exhaust when casted from their piles.
Repeat - Repeating a card plays a free copy with Purge.

Main effects of these keywords:
-0-cost plain Firing cards are basically "wildcards" that can transform into any card from their respective pile.
-If a card has its own effects, then Fires, you can kind of play build-a-card by stacking different effects.
IE:
Open Fire (1 cost, deal 4 damage, Fire Blaster)
-> Peashooter (0 cost, Blaster, deal 3 damage) = 1 cost, deal 7
-> Draining Pulse (1 cost, Blaster, 4 damage + 1 Weak to ALL) = 2 cost, deal 4, deal 4 + 1 Weak to ALL
-> Suppressive Fire (1 cost, Blaster, 1 Weak + 1 Vuln to ALL when Fired) = 2 cost, deal 4, 1 weak + vuln to ALL
-> Blockblast (1 cost, Blaster, deal 6 damage + Fire 1 Shield) -> Shields Up (1 cost, gain 7 Block) = 3 cost, deal 10 damage, gain 7 block

Numbers are a little weak due to the versatility of the option, and totally working stuff

Identities of the 3 keywords:
-Blasters typically deal damage or debuff.
-Shields grant block or other evasive maneuvers. They also recur cards, or Scry.
-Cores usually grant energy and have stranger effects.

Pillars/Archetypes:
-Energy Management (setups: cores/core spam, Energy Next Turn cards, etc. payoffs: x-cost cards, Super Duper Beam, powers)
-Master Blaster (setups: blasters, 0-cost cards, card generation. payoffs: Full Force, Array Shot, any major blaster-spam stuff, Super Duper Beam)
-Greater AI (setups: shields, Scries, card manip, Energy Next turn. payoffs: make cards that are better when specifically used at different times, planning ahead-style stuff, especially useful when paired with the number of options Mecha gives you. also Super Duper Beam (scry off those Voids!)
-Mirroring Master (setups: Repeats, higher-cost cards, draw, cores/shields. payoffs: repeating big cards for big effects, cards that scale the more you play them/the more happens, etc)
